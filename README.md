## Test-driven development:

TDD is an approach to software development that is meant to make you think through the requirements and/or design you want before you start writing the code.  
You write a test, and then just enough code to fulfill that test. Only once that is done do you write and work to fulfill the second test, and so on.  
It should follow the following steps:
+ Write a failing test
  + Ie you should write a test for what you want to accomplish; this test should not succeed based on the current code
+ Write code to make the test pass
  + Write just enough code required to make the text pass
  + Also make sure that previous tests are still passing
+ Refactor the new code
  + Try to clean up and simplify the code you've just written, while still maintaining all new features.
