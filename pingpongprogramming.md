Ping Pong Programming (P3 for short) is a programming technique which combines Test-driven development (TDD) and pair programming.

## Key features:
* programming in a pair
* testing after each significant change/step in code
* as small steps as possible

It is described by Dave Hoover in [his article on agile connection](https://www.agileconnection.com/article/ping-pong-programming-enhance-your-tdd-and-pair-programming-practices?page=0%2C1) as:

`... a curious mix of competition and collaboration...`

## How it works:
A pair (A and B) are working on the same project
1. A writes a test and makes sure it fails
2. B writes code which will pass A's test
3. B then writes a test which will fail
4. A then writes code which will pa ss B's test
